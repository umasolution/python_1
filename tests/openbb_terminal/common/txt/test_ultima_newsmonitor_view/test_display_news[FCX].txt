[green]Economic Risk[/green] ([3mCopper prices have declined 13% over the last six weeks to US$3.65 per pound, primarily due to weaker than expected demand in China. The country's economy has not recovered as rapidly as projected after it ended its zero-COVID policy around the start of 2023. Additionally, rising global supply has contributed to the falling price trajectory, with First Quantum Minerals resuming copper shipments from its Cobre Panama mine and China's CMOC Group set to begin producing copper in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This decline in copper prices could negatively impact Freeport-McMoRan's financial performance. - The Deep Dive (https://thedeepdive.ca/copper-declines-on-weak-china-macro-data-little-reason-to-expect-a-near-term-rebound/)[0m)
