Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data.
Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal
adjustment. In these cases, the NSA series will be updated normally; but the SA series will also be
updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU12331005552000001).  Some seasonally adjusted series may
exhibit negative values because they are created from a seasonal adjustment process regardless of
the actual meaning or interpretation of the given indicator."

Many series include both seasonally adjusted (SA) and not seasonally adjusted (NSA) data.
Occasionally, updates to the data will not include sufficient seasonal factors to trigger a seasonal

updated with the NSA data. The NSA series can be located here here
