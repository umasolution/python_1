usage: skew [-w N_WINDOW]

Skewness is a measure of asymmetry or distortion of symmetric distribution. It measures the deviation of the given distribution of a random variable from a symmetric distribution, such as normal distribution. A normal distribution
is without any skewness, as it is symmetrical on both sides. Hence, a curve is regarded as skewed if it is shifted towards the right or the left.

optional arguments:
  -w N_WINDOW, --window N_WINDOW
                        window length (default: 14)


Examples:
- Calculate skewness for the default window length of 14 for a stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/skew
- Determine the skewness of a stock using a custom window length of 30: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/skew -w 30
- Analyze the skewness for a stock with a 50-day window: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/skew --window 50
