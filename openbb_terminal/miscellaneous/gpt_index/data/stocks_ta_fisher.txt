usage: fisher [-l N_LENGTH]

The Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.1 The indicator highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help
in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)


Examples:
- To apply the Fisher Transform with the default length of 14 on a stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/fisher
- To apply the Fisher Transform with a custom length of 10 on a stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/fisher -l 10
- For a stock with a specific symbol, calculate the Fisher Transform using a length of 20: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/fisher --length 20
