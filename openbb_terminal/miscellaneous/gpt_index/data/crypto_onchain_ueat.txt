Display number of unique ethereum addresses which made a transaction in given time interval, [Source: https://graphql.bitquery.io/]

optional arguments:
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        display N number records. (Maximum available time period is 90 days.Depending on chosen time period, display N records will be recalculated. E.g.For interval: month, and number: 10, period of calculation
                        equals to 300, but because of max days limit: 90, it will only return last 3 months (3 records). (default: 10)
  -s {date,uniqueSenders,transactions,averageGasPrice,mediumGasPrice,maximumGasPrice}, --sort {date,uniqueSenders,transactions,averageGasPrice,mediumGasPrice,maximumGasPrice}
                        Sort by given column. (default: date)
  -i {day,month,week}, --interval {day,month,week}
                        Time interval in which ethereum address made transaction. month, week or day. Maximum time period is 90 days (3 months, 14 weeks) (default: day)

Examples:
- To display the number of unique Ethereum addresses with transactions in the last 10 days: crypto/onchain/ueat
- To show unique Ethereum addresses with transactions in the last 5 weeks: crypto/onchain/ueat -l 5 -i week
- To display unique Ethereum addresses with transactions in the last 3 months, sorted by the number of transactions: crypto/onchain/ueat -l 3 -i month -s transactions
- To show the last 20 days of unique Ethereum addresses with transactions, sorted by average gas price: crypto/onchain/ueat -l 20 -s averageGasPrice
- To display unique Ethereum addresses with transactions in the last 10 days, sorted by maximum gas price in ascending order: crypto/onchain/ueat -s maximumGasPrice -r
- To show unique Ethereum addresses with transactions in the last 7 weeks, sorted by unique senders in ascending order: crypto/onchain/ueat -l 7 -i week -s uniqueSenders -r
