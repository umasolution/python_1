usage: spot [-m MATURITY] [-c CATEGORY] [-d] [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE]

The spot rate for any maturity is the yield on a bond that provides a single payment at that maturity. This is a zero coupon bond. Because each spot rate pertains to a single cashflow, it is the relevant interest rate concept for
discounting a pension liability at the same maturity.

optional arguments:
  -m MATURITY, --maturity MATURITY
                        What maturity you'd like to collect data for (default: 10y)
  -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY
                        What category you'd like to collect data for (default: spot_rate)
  -d, --description     Whether to provide a description of the data. (default: False)
  -s START_DATE, --start START_DATE
                        Starting date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: 1980-01-01)
  -e END_DATE, --end END_DATE
                        Ending date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
