usage: donchian [-u N_LENGTH_UPPER] [-l N_LENGTH_LOWER]

Donchian Channels are three lines generated by moving average calculations that comprise an indicator formed by upper and lower bands around a midrange or median band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over N
periods while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over N periods. The area between the upper and lower bands represents the Donchian Channel.

optional arguments:
  -u N_LENGTH_UPPER, --length_upper N_LENGTH_UPPER
                        length (default: 20)
  -l N_LENGTH_LOWER, --length_lower N_LENGTH_LOWER
                        length (default: 20)


Examples:
- To plot Donchian Channels for a forex pair with default length values: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/donchian
- To plot Donchian Channels for a forex pair with a custom upper length of 30: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/donchian -u 30
- To plot Donchian Channels for a forex pair with a custom lower length of 10: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/donchian -l 10
- To plot Donchian Channels for a forex pair with custom upper and lower lengths of 25 and 15 respectively: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/donchian -u 25 -l 15
