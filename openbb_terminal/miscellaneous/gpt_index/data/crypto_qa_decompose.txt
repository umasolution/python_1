usage: decompose [-m]

Decompose time series as: - Additive Time Series = Level + CyclicTrend + Residual + Seasonality - Multiplicative Time Series = Level * CyclicTrend * Residual * Seasonality

optional arguments:
  -m, --multiplicative  decompose using multiplicative model instead of additive (default: False)


Examples:
- To decompose a time series using the additive model for a specific coin: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/decompose
- For decomposing a time series using the multiplicative model, use this command: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/decompose -m
- Decompose a cryptocurrency time series with the multiplicative model: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/decompose --multiplicative
- Analyze a time series for a cryptocurrency with the additive model: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/decompose
