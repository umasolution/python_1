usage: fisher [-l N_LENGTH]

The Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.1 The indicator highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help
in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)


Examples:
- To calculate the Fisher Transform for an ETF with the default length: etf/ta/fisher
- To calculate the Fisher Transform for an ETF with a custom length of 20: etf/ta/fisher -l 20
- For a specific ETF, load the symbol and calculate the Fisher Transform: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/fisher
- Load an ETF symbol and calculate the Fisher Transform with a length of 10: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/fisher -l 10
