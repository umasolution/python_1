usage: donchian [-u N_LENGTH_UPPER] [-l N_LENGTH_LOWER]

Donchian Channels are three lines generated by moving average calculations that comprise an indicator formed by upper and lower bands around a midrange or median band. The upper band marks the highest price of a security over N
periods while the lower band marks the lowest price of a security over N periods. The area between the upper and lower bands represents the Donchian Channel.

optional arguments:
  -u N_LENGTH_UPPER, --length_upper N_LENGTH_UPPER
                        length (default: 20)
  -l N_LENGTH_LOWER, --length_lower N_LENGTH_LOWER
                        length (default: 20)
