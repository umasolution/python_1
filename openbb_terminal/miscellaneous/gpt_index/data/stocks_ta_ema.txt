The Exponential Moving Average is a staple of technical analysis and is used in countless technical indicators. In a Simple Moving Average, each value in the time period carries equal weight, and values outside of the time period
are not included in the average. However, the Exponential Moving Average is a cumulative calculation, including all data. Past values have a diminishing contribution to the average, while more recent values have a greater
contribution. This method allows the moving average to be more responsive to changes in the data.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for the default window lengths of 20 and 50: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average with a custom window length of 30: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 30
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average with multiple custom window lengths, such as 10 and 40: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 10,40
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average with an offset of 5: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -o 5
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average with a custom window length of 30 and an offset of 5: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 30 -o 5
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average with multiple custom window lengths, such as 10 and 40, and an offset of 5: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 10,40 -o 5
- Show me the 30 day ema of SYMBOL stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/ema -l 30
