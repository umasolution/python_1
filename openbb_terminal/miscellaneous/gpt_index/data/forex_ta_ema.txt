The Exponential Moving Average is a staple of technical analysis and is used in countless technical indicators. In a Simple Moving Average, each value in the time period carries equal weight, and values outside of the time period
are not included in the average. However, the Exponential Moving Average is a cumulative calculation, including all data. Past values have a diminishing contribution to the average, while more recent values have a greater
contribution. This method allows the moving average to be more responsive to changes in the data.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a forex pair with default window lengths: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/ema
- For a specific forex pair, calculate the Exponential Moving Average with a custom window length of 30: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/ema -l 30
- Calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a forex pair using multiple window lengths of 10 and 40: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/ema -l 10,40
- To obtain the Exponential Moving Average for a forex pair with a custom window length of 25 and an offset of 5: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/ema -l 25 -o 5
- For a specific forex pair, calculate the Exponential Moving Average with a window length of 15 and an offset of 3: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/ema -l 15 -o 3
