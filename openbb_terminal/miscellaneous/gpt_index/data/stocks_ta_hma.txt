usage: hma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]

The Hull Moving Average solves the age old dilemma of making a moving average more responsive to current price activity whilst maintaining curve smoothness. In fact the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve
smoothing at the same time.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [10, 20])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To display the Hull Moving Average for a stock with default window lengths: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma
- For a custom window length of 15 and an offset of 2: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 15 -o 2
- To display the Hull Moving Average with multiple window lengths, 10 and 30: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 10,30
- Plot the Hull Moving Average for a stock with a window length of 25: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 25
- To view the Hull Moving Average with an offset of 5: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -o 5
- Display the Hull Moving Average for a stock with a custom window length of 40 and no offset: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 40 -o 0
