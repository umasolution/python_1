parent_command:economy
usage: plot [--y1 YAXIS1] [--y2 YAXIS2]

This command can plot any data on two y-axes obtained from the macro, fred, index and treasury commands. To be able to use this data, just load the available series from the previous commands. For example 'macro -p GDP -c Germany
Netherlands' will store the data for usage in this command. Therefore, it allows you to plot different time series in one graph. The example above could be plotted the following way: 'plot --y1 Germany_GDP --y2 Netherlands_GDP' or
'plot --y1 Germany_GDP Netherlands_GDP'

optional arguments:
  --y1 YAXIS1  Select the data you wish to plot on the first y-axis. You can select multiple variables here. (default: )
  --y2 YAXIS2  Select the data you wish to plot on the second y-axis. You can select multiple variables here. (default: )


Examples:
- Retrieve GDP data for Germany and Netherlands and plot them on the same graph: economy/macro -p GDP -c Germany Netherlands; economy/plot --y1 Germany_GDP Netherlands_GDP
- Load GDP data for Germany and plot it on the first y-axis: economy/macro -p GDP -c Germany; economy/plot --y1 Germany_GDP
- Get GDP data for Germany and Unemployment data for the USA, then plot them on separate y-axes: economy/macro -p GDP -c Germany; economy/macro -p Unemployment -c USA; economy/plot --y1 Germany_GDP --y2 USA_Unemployment
- Load and plot multiple data series on the first y-axis: economy/macro -p GDP -c Germany Netherlands; economy/macro -p Unemployment -c USA; economy/plot --y1 Germany_GDP Netherlands_GDP USA_Unemployment
- Retrieve and plot data series on both y-axes: economy/macro -p GDP -c Germany Netherlands; economy/macro -p Inflation -c USA UK; economy/plot --y1 Germany_GDP Netherlands_GDP --y2 USA_Inflation UK_Inflation
