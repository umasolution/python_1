usage: wma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]

A Weighted Moving Average puts more weight on recent data and less on past data. This is done by multiplying each barâ€™s price by a weighting factor. Because of its unique calculation, WMA will follow prices more closely than a
corresponding Simple Moving Average.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the weighted moving average for a coin with default window lengths: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/wma
- To calculate the weighted moving average for a coin with a single window length: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/wma -l 30
- To calculate the weighted moving average for a coin with multiple window lengths: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/wma -l 10,30,50
- To calculate the weighted moving average for a coin with a specific offset: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/wma -o 5
- To calculate the weighted moving average for a coin with custom window lengths and offset: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/wma -l 15,40 -o 3
