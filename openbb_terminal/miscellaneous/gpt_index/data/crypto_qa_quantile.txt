usage: quantile [-w N_WINDOW] [-q F_QUANTILE]

The quantiles are values which divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile. For example, the median is a quantile. The median is the central value of the distribution, such that
half the points are less than or equal to it and half are greater than or equal to it. By default, q is set at 0.5, which effectively is median. Change q to get the desired quantile (0<q<1).

optional arguments:
  -w N_WINDOW, --window N_WINDOW
                        window length (default: 14)
  -q F_QUANTILE, --quantile F_QUANTILE
                        quantile (default: 0.5)


Examples:
- To calculate the median for a <COIN> over the default window length: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/quantile
- Calculate the 25th percentile for a <COIN> over the default window length: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/quantile -q 0.25
- Calculate the median for a <COIN> over a custom window length of 30 days: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/quantile -w 30
- Calculate the 75th percentile for a <COIN> with a custom window length of 20 days: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/quantile -w 20 -q 0.75
