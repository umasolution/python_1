usage: wma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]

A Weighted Moving Average puts more weight on recent data and less on past data. This is done by multiplying each barâ€™s price by a weighting factor. Because of its unique calculation, WMA will follow prices more closely than a
corresponding Simple Moving Average.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the weighted moving average with default window lengths for a stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/wma
- Calculate the weighted moving average with a custom window length of 30 for a specific stock: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/wma -l 30
- Obtain the weighted moving average for a stock with multiple window lengths, 10 and 40: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/wma -l 10,40
- Calculate the weighted moving average for a stock, offset by 5 days: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/wma -o 5
- For a specific stock, compute the weighted moving average with a custom window length of 25 and an offset of 3 days: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/ta/wma -l 25 -o 3
