Get 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Selected Treasury Constant Maturity data. Constant maturity is the theoretical value of a U.S. Treasury that is based on recent values of auctioned U.S. Treasuries. The value is obtained
by the U.S. Treasury on a daily basis through interpolation of the Treasury yield curve which, in turn, is based on closing bid-yields of actively-traded Treasury securities.

optional arguments:
  -p {3_month,2_year}, --parameter {3_month,2_year}
                        Selected treasury constant maturity to subtract (default: 3_month)
  -s START_DATE, --start START_DATE
                        Starting date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
  -e END_DATE, --end END_DATE
                        Ending date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
