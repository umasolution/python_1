parent_command:etf/ta
usage: cci [-l N_LENGTH] [-s N_SCALAR]

The CCI is designed to detect beginning and ending market trends. The range of 100 to -100 is the normal trading range. CCI values outside of this range indicate overbought or oversold conditions. You can also look for price
divergence in the CCI. If the price is making new highs, and the CCI is not, then a price correction is likely.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)
  -s N_SCALAR, --scalar N_SCALAR
                        scalar (default: 0.015)


Examples:
- To calculate the CCI for an ETF with the default settings, use: etf/ta/cci
- If you want to specify the length for the CCI calculation, try: etf/ta/cci -l 20
- To adjust the scalar for the CCI, use the command: etf/ta/cci -s 0.02
- For a custom CCI calculation with a specific length and scalar, enter: etf/ta/cci -l 30 -s 0.025
