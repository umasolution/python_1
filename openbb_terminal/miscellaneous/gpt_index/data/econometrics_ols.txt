- Run an OLS regression with historical volume as the dependent variable and historical open as the independent variable: econometrics/ols -d historical.volume -i historical.open
- Execute an OLS regression analysis using historical close as the dependent variable and historical high and low as independent variables: econometrics/ols -d historical.close -i historical.high,historical.low
