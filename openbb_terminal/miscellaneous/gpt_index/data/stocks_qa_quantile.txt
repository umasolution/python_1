usage: quantile [-w N_WINDOW] [-q F_QUANTILE]

The quantiles are values which divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile. For example, the median is a quantile. The median is the central value of the distribution, such that
half the points are less than or equal to it and half are greater than or equal to it. By default, q is set at 0.5, which effectively is median. Change q to get the desired quantile (0<q<1).

optional arguments:
  -w N_WINDOW, --window N_WINDOW
                        window length (default: 14)
  -q F_QUANTILE, --quantile F_QUANTILE
                        quantile (default: 0.5)


Examples:
- To calculate the median for <SYMBOL> with a window length of 14: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/quantile -w 14
- To calculate the 25th percentile for <SYMBOL> using the default window length: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/quantile -q 0.25
- For <SYMBOL>, find the 75th percentile with a window length of 20: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/quantile -w 20 -q 0.75
- To obtain the median for <SYMBOL> using the default settings: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/quantile
- Calculate the 90th percentile for <SYMBOL> with a window length of 30: stocks/load <SYMBOL>/qa/quantile -w 30 -q 0.9
