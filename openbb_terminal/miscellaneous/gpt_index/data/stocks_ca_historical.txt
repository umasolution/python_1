Summary: The historical command allows you to compare historical price data between similar companies. You can choose the type of candle data to use (open, high, low, close, or adjusted close), normalize the prices on a 0-1 scale, and set a specific start and end date for the comparison. Additionally, you can export the data in various formats and save it to a specific excel sheet.
