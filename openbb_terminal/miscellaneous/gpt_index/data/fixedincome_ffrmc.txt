Get Selected Treasury Constant Maturity Minus Federal Funds Rate. Constant maturity is the theoretical value of a U.S. Treasury that is based on recent values of auctioned U.S. Treasuries. The value is obtained by the U.S. Treasury
on a daily basis through interpolation of the Treasury yield curve which, in turn, is based on closing bid-yields of actively-traded Treasury securities.

optional arguments:
  -p {10_year,5_year,1_year,6_month,3_month}, --parameter {10_year,5_year,1_year,6_month,3_month}
                        Selected Treasury Constant Maturity (default: 10_year)
  -s START_DATE, --start START_DATE
                        Starting date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
  -e END_DATE, --end END_DATE
                        Ending date (YYYY-MM-DD) of data (default: None)
