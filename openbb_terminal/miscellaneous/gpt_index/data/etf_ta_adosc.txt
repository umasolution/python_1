usage: adosc [--open] [--fast N_LENGTH_FAST] [--slow N_LENGTH_SLOW]

Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator, also known as the Chaikin Oscillator is essentially a momentum indicator, but of the Accumulation-Distribution line rather than merely price. It looks at both the strength of price moves and
the underlying buying and selling pressure during a given time period. The oscillator reading above zero indicates net buying pressure, while one below zero registers net selling pressure. Divergence between the indicator and pure
price moves are the most common signals from the indicator, and often flag market turning points.

optional arguments:
  --open                uses open value of stock (default: False)
  --fast N_LENGTH_FAST  fast length (default: 3)
  --slow N_LENGTH_SLOW  slow length (default: 10)


Examples:
- To analyze the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator for an ETF: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/adosc
- To use the open value of the stock when calculating the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/adosc --open
- To customize the fast and slow lengths for the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/adosc --fast 5 --slow 15
- To modify only the fast length when analyzing the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/adosc --fast 7
- To change only the slow length when calculating the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/adosc --slow 20
