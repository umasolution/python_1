usage: aroon [-l N_LENGTH] [-s N_SCALAR] [-o N_OFFSET]

The word aroon is Sanskrit for "dawn's early light." The Aroon indicator attempts to show when a new trend is dawning. The indicator consists of two lines (Up and Down) that measure how long it has been since the highest
high/lowest low has occurred within an n period range. When the Aroon Up is staying between 70 and 100 then it indicates an upward trend. When the Aroon Down is staying between 70 and 100 then it indicates an downward trend. A
strong upward trend is indicated when the Aroon Up is above 70 while the Aroon Down is below 30. Likewise, a strong downward trend is indicated when the Aroon Down is above 70 while the Aroon Up is below 30. Also look for
crossovers. When the Aroon Down crosses above the Aroon Up, it indicates a weakening of the upward trend (and vice versa).

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 25)
  -s N_SCALAR, --scalar N_SCALAR
                        scalar (default: 100)
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- Analyze the Aroon indicator for a forex pair with default settings: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/aroon
- Examine the Aroon indicator for a forex pair with a custom length of 30: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/aroon -l 30
- Study the Aroon indicator for a forex pair with a custom scalar of 200: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/aroon -s 200
- Review the Aroon indicator for a forex pair with an offset of 5: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/aroon -o 5
- Investigate the Aroon indicator for a forex pair with custom length, scalar, and offset values: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/aroon -l 30 -s 200 -o 5
