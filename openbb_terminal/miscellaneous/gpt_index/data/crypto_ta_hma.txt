usage: hma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]

The Hull Moving Average solves the age old dilemma of making a moving average more responsive to current price activity whilst maintaining curve smoothness. In fact the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve
smoothing at the same time.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [10, 20])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the Hull Moving Average for a specific cryptocurrency with default length and offset: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/hma
- To calculate the Hull Moving Average for a specific cryptocurrency with a custom length of 15: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/hma -l 15
- To calculate the Hull Moving Average for a specific cryptocurrency with custom lengths of 10 and 30: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/hma -l 10,30
- To calculate the Hull Moving Average for a specific cryptocurrency with a custom offset of 5: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/hma -o 5
- To calculate the Hull Moving Average for a specific cryptocurrency with custom lengths of 10 and 30, and an offset of 5: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/hma -l 10,30 -o 5
