Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator, also known as the Chaikin Oscillator is essentially a momentum indicator, but of the Accumulation-Distribution line rather than merely price. It looks at both the strength of price moves and
the underlying buying and selling pressure during a given time period. The oscillator reading above zero indicates net buying pressure, while one below zero registers net selling pressure. Divergence between the indicator and pure
price moves are the most common signals from the indicator, and often flag market turning points.

optional arguments:
  --open                uses open value of stock (default: False)
  --fast N_LENGTH_FAST  fast length (default: 3)
  --slow N_LENGTH_SLOW  slow length (default: 10)


Examples:
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator for a cryptocurrency using default settings: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator using open values of the cryptocurrency: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc --open
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator with a custom fast length of 5: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc --fast 5
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator with a custom slow length of 15: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc --slow 15
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator with custom fast and slow lengths (7 and 20): crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc --fast 7 --slow 20
- To calculate the Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator using open values and custom fast and slow lengths (4 and 12): crypto/load <COIN>/ta/adosc --open --fast 4 --slow 12
