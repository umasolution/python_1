usage: fisher [-l N_LENGTH]

The Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.1 The indicator highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help
in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)


Examples:
- To apply the Fisher Transform with the default length of 14 on a specific cryptocurrency: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher
- To calculate the Fisher Transform for a cryptocurrency using a custom length of 20: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher -l 20
- For analyzing a cryptocurrency's price trend using the Fisher Transform: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher
- In order to identify potential turning points in a cryptocurrency's price with a custom length of 10: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher -l 10
- To convert a cryptocurrency's prices into a Gaussian normal distribution using the Fisher Transform: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher
- For isolating price waves within a trend of a specific cryptocurrency using the Fisher Transform and a custom length of 25: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/fisher -l 25
