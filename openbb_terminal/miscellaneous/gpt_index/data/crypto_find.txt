Find similar coin by name, symbol, or id. If you don't remember exact name or id of the Coin at CoinGecko, Binance, Coinbase or CoinPaprika you can use this command to display coins with similar name, symbol or id to your search
query. Example of usage: coin name is something like "polka". So I can try: find -c polka -k name -t 25 It will search for coin that has similar name to polka and display top 25 matches. -c, --coin stands for coin - you provide
here your search query -k, --key it's a searching key. You can search by symbol, id or name of coin -l, --limit it displays top N number of records. coins: Shows list of coins available on CoinGecko, CoinPaprika and Binance.If you
provide name of coin then in result you will see ids of coins with best match for all mentioned services. If you provide "ALL" in your coin search query, then all coins will be displayed. To move over coins you can use pagination
mechanism with skip, top params. E.g. coins ALL --skip 100 --limit 30 then all coins from 100 to 130 will be displayed. By default skip = 0, limit = 10. If you won't provide source of the data everything will be displayed
(CoinGecko, CoinPaprika, Binance). If you want to search only in given source then use --source flag. E.g. if you want to find coin with name uniswap on CoinPaprika then use: coins uniswap --source cp --limit 10
