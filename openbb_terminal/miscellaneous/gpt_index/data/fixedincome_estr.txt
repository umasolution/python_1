usage: estr [-p {volume_weighted_trimmed_mean_rate,number_of_transactions,number_of_active_banks,total_volume,share_of_volume_of_the_5_largest_active_banks,rate_at_75th_percentile_of_volume,rate_at_25th_percentile_of_volume}]
            [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE]

The euro short-term rate (€STR) reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of banks located in the euro area. The €STR is published on each TARGET2 business day based on transactions conducted and settled on
the previous TARGET2 business day (the reporting date “T”) with a maturity date of T+1 which are deemed to have been executed at arm’s length and thus reflect market rates in an unbiased way.

optional arguments:
  -p {volume_weighted_trimmed_mean_rate,number_of_transactions,number_of_active_banks,total_volume,share_of_volume_of_the_5_largest_active_banks,rate_at_75th_percentile_of_volume,rate_at_25th_percentile_of_volume}, --parameter {volume_weighted_trimmed_mean_rate,number_of_transactions,number_of_active_banks,total_volume,share_of_volume_of_the_5_largest_active_banks,rate_at_75th_percentile_of_volume,rate_at_25th_percentile_of_volume}
