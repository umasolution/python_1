                        Perspective of CPI you wish to obtain. This can be ENRG (energy), FOOD (food), TOT (total) or TOT_FOODENRG (total excluding food and energy) (default: TOT)
  --frequency {M,Q,A}   What frequency you'd like to collect data for (default: M)
  -u {AGRWTH,IDX2015}, --units {AGRWTH,IDX2015}
