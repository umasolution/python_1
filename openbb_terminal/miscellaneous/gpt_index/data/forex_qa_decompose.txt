usage: decompose [-m]

Decompose time series as: - Additive Time Series = Level + CyclicTrend + Residual + Seasonality - Multiplicative Time Series = Level * CyclicTrend * Residual * Seasonality

optional arguments:
  -m, --multiplicative  decompose using multiplicative model instead of additive (default: False)


Examples:
- Decompose the time series for a forex pair using the additive model: forex/load <PAIR>/qa/decompose
- Decompose the time series for a forex pair using the multiplicative model: forex/load <PAIR>/qa/decompose -m
- Analyze a forex pair's time series with a multiplicative decomposition: forex/load <PAIR>/qa/decompose --multiplicative
