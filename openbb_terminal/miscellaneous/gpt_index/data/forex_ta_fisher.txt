usage: fisher [-l N_LENGTH]

The Fisher Transform is a technical indicator created by John F. Ehlers that converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution.1 The indicator highlights when prices have moved to an extreme, based on recent prices. This may help
in spotting turning points in the price of an asset. It also helps show the trend and isolate the price waves within a trend.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)


Examples:
- To apply the Fisher Transform with default length on a forex pair: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/fisher
- To calculate the Fisher Transform for a specific forex pair with a custom length of 10: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/fisher -l 10
- Apply the Fisher Transform to a forex pair with a length of 20: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/fisher --length 20
- Calculate the Fisher Transform for a forex pair using a length of 5: forex/load <PAIR>/ta/fisher -l 5
