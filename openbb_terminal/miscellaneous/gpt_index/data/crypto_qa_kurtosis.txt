usage: kurtosis [-w N_WINDOW]

Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it
for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.

optional arguments:
  -w N_WINDOW, --window N_WINDOW
                        window length (default: 14)


Examples:
- To calculate kurtosis for a crypto coin with the default window length: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/kurtosis
- To calculate kurtosis for a crypto coin with a custom window length of 30: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/kurtosis -w 30
- For a specific crypto coin, calculate kurtosis using a 50-period window: crypto/load <COIN>/qa/kurtosis --window 50
