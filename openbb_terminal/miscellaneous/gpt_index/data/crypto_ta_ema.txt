The Exponential Moving Average is a staple of technical analysis and is used in countless technical indicators. In a Simple Moving Average, each value in the time period carries equal weight, and values outside of the time period
are not included in the average. However, the Exponential Moving Average is a cumulative calculation, including all data. Past values have a diminishing contribution to the average, while more recent values have a greater
contribution. This method allows the moving average to be more responsive to changes in the data.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [20, 50])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a cryptocurrency with default window lengths: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a cryptocurrency with custom window lengths of 10 and 30: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 10,30
- To calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a cryptocurrency with a custom window length of 100 and an offset of 5: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 100 -o 5
- For a specific cryptocurrency, calculate the Exponential Moving Average using multiple window lengths of 10, 20, and 50: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 10,20,50
- To compute the Exponential Moving Average for a cryptocurrency with a window length of 200 and no offset: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 200
- For a specific cryptocurrency, calculate the Exponential Moving Average with an offset of 10: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -o 10
- To determine the Exponential Moving Average for a cryptocurrency using a custom window length of 150: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 150
- For a specific cryptocurrency, calculate the Exponential Moving Average with a window length of 75 and an offset of 3: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/ema -l 75 -o 3
