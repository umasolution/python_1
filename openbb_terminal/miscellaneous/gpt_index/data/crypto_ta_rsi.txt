usage: rsi [-l N_LENGTH] [-s N_SCALAR] [-d N_DRIFT]

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculates a ratio of the recent upward price movements to the absolute price movement. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100. The RSI is interpreted as an overbought/oversold indicator when the value is
over 70/below 30. You can also look for divergence with price. If the price is making new highs/lows, and the RSI is not, it indicates a reversal.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        length (default: 14)
  -s N_SCALAR, --scalar N_SCALAR
                        scalar (default: 100)
  -d N_DRIFT, --drift N_DRIFT
                        drift (default: 1)


Examples:
- To calculate the RSI for a cryptocurrency with default settings: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/rsi
- To calculate the RSI for a cryptocurrency with a custom length of 20: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/rsi -l 20
- To calculate the RSI for a cryptocurrency with a custom scalar of 200: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/rsi -s 200
- To calculate the RSI for a cryptocurrency with a custom drift of 2: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/rsi -d 2
- To calculate the RSI for a cryptocurrency with custom length, scalar, and drift: crypto/load <COIN>/ta/rsi -l 20 -s 200 -d 2
