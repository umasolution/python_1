usage: hma [-l N_LENGTH] [-o N_OFFSET]

The Hull Moving Average solves the age old dilemma of making a moving average more responsive to current price activity whilst maintaining curve smoothness. In fact the HMA almost eliminates lag altogether and manages to improve
smoothing at the same time.

optional arguments:
  -l N_LENGTH, --length N_LENGTH
                        Window lengths. Multiple values indicated as comma separated values. (default: [10, 20])
  -o N_OFFSET, --offset N_OFFSET
                        offset (default: 0)


Examples:
- To plot the Hull Moving Average for an ETF with default window lengths: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma
- To plot the Hull Moving Average for an ETF with a specific window length: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 30
- To plot the Hull Moving Average for an ETF with multiple window lengths: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 10,50,100
- To plot the Hull Moving Average for an ETF with a specific offset: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -o 5
- To plot the Hull Moving Average for an ETF with a custom window length and offset: etf/load <SYMBOL>/ta/hma -l 40 -o 10
