usage: quantile [-w N_WINDOW] [-q F_QUANTILE]

The quantiles are values which divide the distribution such that there is a given proportion of observations below the quantile. For example, the median is a quantile. The median is the central value of the distribution, such that
half the points are less than or equal to it and half are greater than or equal to it. By default, q is set at 0.5, which effectively is median. Change q to get the desired quantile (0<q<1).

optional arguments:
  -w N_WINDOW, --window N_WINDOW
                        window length (default: 14)
  -q F_QUANTILE, --quantile F_QUANTILE
                        quantile (default: 0.5)


Examples:
- Calculate the default quantile (median) for the economy data: economy/qa/quantile
- Calculate the 0.25 quantile for the economy data: economy/qa/quantile -q 0.25
- Calculate the median with a window length of 20: economy/qa/quantile -w 20
- Calculate the 0.75 quantile with a window length of 30: economy/qa/quantile -q 0.75 -w 30
