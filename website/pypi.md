#### GENERATE INSIGHTS 10X FASTER

For most of the functionalities, adding `_chart` to the function will allow you to visualize the output directly from a Jupyter Notebook. Not only speeding up the time it takes to create a plot for the data you are interested in, but making building custom reports much faster.
