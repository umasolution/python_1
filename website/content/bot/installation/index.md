Currently we support [Discord](installation/discord) and [Telegram](installation/telegram) for the OpenBB Bot. More integrations are under way.

In order to use OpenBB Bot in one of these chatting applications you need to either:
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Belong to a server that has already added our bot (<strong>INDIVIDUAL</strong>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Own a server and you can easily add our bot (<strong>SERVER</strong>)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

By using the [Linked Platforms page](https://my.openbb.co/app/bot/linked-platforms) you are also able to link your Discord/Telegram account to the OpenBB Bot and open up even more features.
