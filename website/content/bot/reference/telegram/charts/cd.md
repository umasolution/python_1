This command allows the user to retrieve a daily candlestick chart for a particular ticker or coin. The candlestick chart provides information about the opening and closing prices of the day, as well as the high and low prices of the day. This data can then be used to analyze the performance of the ticker/coin over time. For example, if the user provides the command "/cd AMD", the chart will be generated for the ticker AMD.
