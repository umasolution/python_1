### Select a Country

To use the menu, a country must be selected, and the default is `united_states`.  To select a different one, type `country`, followed by the `spacebar`.  This will bring up a list that can be picked from using the up/down arrow keys.

Refresh the screen, by typing `?`, to verify the choice has been made.

### Search

The most effective way to sift through a vast quantity of funds is to use the `search` function broadly, then narrow the focus using the built-in filters on the displayed table.  In the example below, there are 668 results returned for `RBC` and `Canada`.  Filtering for money market funds gets it down to only ten funds.

```console
/funds/country canada/search rbc --limit 1000
```

### Load

A mutual fund is loaded by using the ID number, which is the column labeled, `SECID`, on the left side of the table.

```console
load F0CAN05LTL
```

```console
The fund RBC Premium Money Market Fund A - 52.8.RBF447 (F0CAN05LTL) was successfully loaded.
```

## Examples

### holdings

With a fund loaded, get the weighting of the portfolio using the `holdings` command.

:::note
The holdings data returned will vary by country.  Some will only return the top ten, while others will publish the entire portfolio.

```console
/funds/country canada/load F00000U48G/holdings
```

In contrast, the iShares Developed Real Estate Index Fund Investor A Shares, from the United States, returns 449 results.

```console
funds/country united_states/load F00000VW8Z/holdings

The `sector` command displays a breakdown of sector weightings, compared against the benchmark index and broad category.

```console

```
